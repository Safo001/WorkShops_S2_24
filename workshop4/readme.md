# Assembling and Testing Your Drone
Firstly, make sure that you have all of your parts:

- Air unit
- 2x silver motors
- 2x black motors
- 4x propellers
- Capacitor
- ESC cable
- Air Unit
- 4 * Yellow Grommits
- Battery Cable

And the printed parts:

- Propeller Guards
- Frame
- Battery mount

# Assembly 
Get your Air Unit ready by snaping off the rails, if you haven't already. 

Push 4 grommits into the Air Unit board.

Place the Air Unit into the cavity on the bottom of the frame, and use four M2 bolts to secure it.

Push some bolts through the frame and the guard, so as to align them. Next, screw the motor down onto it.

### Important! The motor nut propeller colours need to the in the same positions as in the videos, as they determine spin direction!

Use 4 M2 bolts to mount the 4 in 1 ESC to the top of the drone.

Solder on the motor wires. The best way to do this is to use your soldering stand to hold the wire against the side of the pad, such that the springiness of the wire puts a slight amount of pressure on the ESC. Clean your iron on the stand, before applying a very small amount of solder to the iron. This solder isn't to secure the wire, but to allow the liquid solder to better transfer heat than a dry iron. Let the pad heat up before you add more solder, and then hold the iron on the pad until the solder flows across it.

Make sure to consider the angle you're soldering from. Put the iron on the side of the ESC away from the components, to reduce the risk of burning them.

The second best, but sometimes needed, way to solder on the wires is by first addind solder to the pad and then melting it while pressing the wire into it. Make sure that the insulation of the wire doesn't touch the solder, and be aware that the wire might heat up. This is a slightly questionable technique, but it's the easiest way to get the job done.

Next, solder the XT30 battery connector and capacitor to the ESC. Trim down the capacitor legs, and strip the insulation back on the battery wires. Press the capacitor legs through the holes in the ESC pads, making sure that the polarity is correct. Use the second hand to position the wire on the outside of the pad, and solder it down.
